At VidyAntara, time slows - and the setting CAN help wash away the deeply ingrained "MUST ALWAYS BE DOING SOMETHING" mindeset which robs us of two things:-

 * **Inner Reflection** - which ultimately builds character and shapes lives
 * **Inner Resolve** - which give us the courage to act out our 'wishes & dreams', even shaping history

NO, there is NO OUTER GURU HERE, just a spiritual treasure trove that speaks to us most sincerely to leave a wholesome, positive imprint on the [TAG]Akashic Records[/TAG].

NO outward signs of its functioning - just a simple request - treat evey moment as a new dawning and let the silence speak.
