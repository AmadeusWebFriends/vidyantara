Poem 1 of 1 Aug

Amidst verdant lawns and meadows
Set against a backdrop of clear skies.
Ensconced in a village, and where children
Laugh - in relief we find more members of our earthly family.

Where trees and plants await your arrival,
Having placed a long distance call.
The song of the birds and insects and the rustling of leaves
Beckon you to enrich the quietude.

Eat to your heartâ€™s fill my friends -
Let your cup runneth over.
Intuit your life's desirous form
That it's bounty may rain on your giving arm.
