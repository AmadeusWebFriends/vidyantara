A delicate subject like "spirituality" needs **delicate handling**.

Each of us have a fixed idea of

* What we are and what the evolutionary aim should be.
* What act of the Divine / Cosmos brought us here.
* Whether we believe in a "religion", "spirituality" and its relationship with science.

These perspectives change with time, as we grow. Ideally for the better as our consciousness expands and we grow in awareness.

Silent contemplation, guided readings and elevating commentaries are some of the ways for it to happen.

In short, we at %VidyAntara% are **pluralists** embodying that future social evolution, seeking to harmonize and integrate all peoples of the world.
