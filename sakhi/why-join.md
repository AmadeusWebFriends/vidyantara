## Ambience

Imagine a place where the colouring of city-life just washes away  and you feel- pristine and magnificent as wished by the Creator.

* You want to walk your dreams and stand your promises.
* Would time slow down? 
* Would you look to the family around you with “new kindled” eyes?
* If so, what would your thoughts be?
