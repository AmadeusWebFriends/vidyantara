Humans with founts of compassion and grace, have always shown the world that a different “NOW” is possible. One has to be “open” to the wisdom constantly percolating to our beings, like ambrosia from heaven.

In a spirit of kindness and patience the “guides” at VidyAntara want you to know that “we care for you, and we have found healing in the depths of time and in the lap of  Mother Earth, we offer you that experience as a gift we wish to share.”

A new spirituality and oneness is re-rooting in this world just like the bhakthi movement a few centuries now thanks through several known and unknown seers. Visitors here  draw from deep wells of healing and resilience.

%Vidya%: It can be experienced here that the space you reclaim towards rebuilding your peace paradigms will be by your inner compass guidance rather than through external influence.
