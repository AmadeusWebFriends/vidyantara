## The Tone

The biggest ongoing activity in a village, away from deadlines and trafficlines is a compelling inner journey (not the constant clamour of outward ambitions and ephemeral things). If we provide the environment, would you make the time? For yourself?

Introducing %VidyAntara% - a retreat without "facilitators" and "guides", only friends and co-combatants in the glory that can be our tomorrow.

Of course, in our rural setting in a village with farms and fields all around, you can enjoy **nature walks** and **village visits**.

## Bonding

On campus, theres a bonding - in 3 key aspects

* with self
* with family and others
* with nature & the infinite (however you wish to describe it)

This could be through activities like gardening, cooking, showing your daughter to fly a kite, or your son how to sew - yes, we like to break the stereotypes :p

And the many many aspects it takes to have true mastery over our own private "Lila" the Divine game
