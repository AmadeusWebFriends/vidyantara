## Self and Family Time

### Family Bonding

* Finding time for the family seems the greatest challenge of all times, these days. Eye contact with warm conversations seem such a luxury.
* VidyAntara attempts to provide the opportunities for families and communities to restore their innate compassionate nature and ability to radiate wellness all around.
* With quiet time, besides a small range of activities you can choose from, at your self paced routine, the rustic milieu provides just the right ethos for recalibrating from chaos to order within.
